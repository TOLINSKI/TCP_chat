            General Information
---------------------------------------------
1. The current UI is console based.
2. This chat is connected to the current machine's LAN address, making it the host/server. 
3. Then Clients can connect to the address and send and receive messages.

                  How To 
---------------------------------------------
1. Must have all files from TCP_chat/Code/ directory in one folder.
2. Run using Windows Power Shell/command prompt:
   py TCP_chat.py
   OR
   Run using  Mac Terminal:
   python3 TCP_chat.py
   Must have Python3 installed on the machine(Win and Mac).
3. When prompted first a server must be initiated, choose option (1), DO NOT CLOSE THE TERMINAL.
4. Open another terminal window in the Code directory and select option (2), DO NOT CLOSE THE TERMINAL.
   When prompted enter a nickname that will be shown when you send messages in the chat.
5. Open another terminal window in the Code directory and follow the previous step, this time with a different nickname.
   again DO NOT CLOSE THE TERMINAL. Now you've got 3 terminal windows open and running.
Now you've got 2 users in a chat room, try to send messages from one user and watch them appear on the other user's terminal.
You may add more users by following step 4 again and again.
